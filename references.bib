  abstract = {¡p¿Swarm systems consist of large numbers of agents that collaborate autonomously. With an appropriate level of human control, swarm systems could be applied in a variety of contexts ranging from urban search and rescue situations to cyber defence. However, the successful deployment of the swarm in such applications is conditioned by the effective coupling between human and swarm. While adaptive autonomy promises to provide enhanced performance in human-machine interaction, distinct factors must be considered for its implementation within human-swarm interaction. This paper reviews the multidisciplinary literature on different aspects contributing to the facilitation of adaptive autonomy in human-swarm interaction. Specifically, five aspects that are necessary for an adaptive agent to operate properly are considered and discussed, including mission objectives, interaction, mission complexity, automation levels, and human states. We distill the corresponding indicators in each of the five aspects, and propose a framework, named MICAH (i.e., Mission-Interaction-Complexity-Automation-Human), which maps the primitive state indicators needed for adaptive human-swarm teaming.¡/p¿}

  abstract = {Despite a long history of research on democratic backsliding, the process itself − in which the executive branch amasses power and undermines democratic processes and institutions − remains poorly understood. We seek to shed light on the underlying mechanisms by studying democratic near misses: cases in which a period of autocratic governance is quickly reversed or full backsliding is prevented at the last minute. Building on the literature on near misses in sociotechnical systems such as nuclear power plants, we adapt the drift-to-danger model to the study of democratic systems. Two key findings emerge: First, democratic backsliding is often triggered by political elites pushing the boundaries of their power by violating norms, which are crucial yet vulnerable safeguards for democracy. Second, democratic backsliding is unpredictable and non-linear, being driven by the interaction between political elites and the public. Norm-violating elites may feel legitimized by a supportive public that sees norm violations as justified. At the same time, political elites may signal that norm-violating behaviour is acceptable, potentially leading the public to adopt anti-democratic beliefs and behaviours. We identify risk factors that make norm violations more likely and outline behavioural sciences-based interventions to address these violations.},

This system utilizes autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with the main advantage of providing on-demand monitoring service faster than the current approaches of using satellite images, manned aircraft and remotely controlled drones. Furthermore, using autonomous drones facilitates minimizing human intervention in risky wildfire zones. In particular, to develop a fully autonomous system, we propose a distributed leader-follower coalition formation model to cluster a set of drones into multiple coalitions that collectively cover the designated monitoring field. The coalition leader is a drone that employs observer drones potentially with different sensing and imaging capabilities to hover in circular paths and collect imagery information from the impacted areas. The objectives of the proposed system include: i) to cover the entire fire zone with a minimum number of drones, and ii) to minimize the energy consumption and latency of the available drones to fly to the fire zone. Simulation results confirm that the performance of the proposed system- without the need for inter-coalition communications- approaches that of a centrally-optimized system. 1.},

A variety of modelling approaches now exist which vary widely in their methodology and underlying assumptions, catering to the needs of the different sub-communities within which they were developed and reflecting the different practical uses for which they are intended. The purpose of the present article is to provide a comprehensive survey of the salient modelling methods which can be found in the literature.

  abstract = {Fires represent one of the most predominant and destructive disasters, which tend to be rapidly increasing and nearly impossible to control. Conventional firefighting methods, which rely on human intervention, are normally time-consuming and unsafe. The implementation of drones for fire prevention and extinguishing provides an efficient substitute, permitting rapid and safe access to areas, which are inaccessible to human firefighters. Building on the successful completion of our previous project with the Department of Civil Defense, entitled "System for Detection, Prediction, and Analysis using IoT," concluded in December 2022, we propose the second part to create a new initiative: "Automatic Fire Extinguishing and Prevention using Drones." This project aims to enhance an automated system that can detect and extinguish fires in real-time, and thus reduce damage to properties and save lives. This system aims to leverage drone technology by developing the efficiency and safety of fire management operations. Drones equipped with thermal cameras, sensors, and fire-suppressant delivery mechanisms are used to detect fire outbreaks early and respond instantly. These drones can access severe areas that are difficult for human firefighters to approach, by providing a more rapid and safer means of combating fires. By integrating real-time data analysis and autonomous navigation, this system allows incessant monitoring and rapid response to different fire incidents. Eventually, the deployment of drones for automatic fire extinguishing and prevention can revolutionise conventional firefighting methods by producing significant improvement in protecting lives and property from the devastating impacts of fires.},

  abstract = {Wildfires are among the biggest problems faced worldwide. They are increasing in severity and frequency, causing economic losses, human death, and significant environmental damage. Environmental factors, such as wind and large forest areas, contribute to the fire spreading over multiple fire spots, all of which grow continuously, making fire suppression extremely difficult. Therefore, fire spots should be coverage simultaneously to contain the spread and prevent coalescence. Therefore, this study presents a new model based on the principles of nature-inspired metaheuristics that uses Swarm Intelligence (SI) to test the effectiveness of using an autonomous and decentralized behaviour for a swarm of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or drones to detect all distributed fire spots and extinguishing them cooperatively. To achieve this goal, we used the improved random walk algorithm to explore the distributed fire spots and a self-coordination mechanism based on the stigmergy as an indirect communication between the swarm drones, taking into account the collision avoidance factor, the amount of extinguishing fluid, and the flight range of the drones. Numerical analysis and extensive simulations were performed to investigate the behaviour of the proposed methods and analyze their performance in terms of the area-coverage rate and total energy required by the drone swarm to complete the task. Our quantitative tests show that the improved model has the best coverage (95.3\%, 84.3\% and 65.8\%, respectively) compared to two other methods Levy Flight (LF) algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), which use the same initial parameter values. The simulation results show that the proposed model performs better than its competitors and saves energy, especially in more complicated situations.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the potential use of fire extinguishing balls as part of a proposed system, where drone and remote-sensing technologies are utilized cooperatively as a supplement to traditional firefighting methods. The proposed system consists of (1) scouting unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to detect spot fires and monitor the risk of wildfire approaching a building, fence, and/or firefighting crew via remote sensing, (2) communication UAS to establish and extend the communication channel between scouting UAS and fire-fighting UAS, and (3) a fire-fighting UAS autonomously traveling to the waypoints to drop fire extinguishing balls (environmental friendly, heat activated suppressants). This concept is under development through a transdisciplinary multi-institutional project. The scope of this paper encloses general illustration of this design, and the experiments conducted so far to evaluate fire extinguishing balls. The results of the experiments show that smaller size fire extinguishing balls available in the global marketplace attached to drones might not be effective in aiding in building fires (unless there are open windows in the buildings already). On the contrary, results show that even the smaller size fire extinguishing balls might be effective in extinguishing short grass fires (around 0.5 kg size ball extinguished a circle of 1-meter of short grass). This finding guided the authors towards wildfire fighting rather than building fires. The paper also demonstrates building of heavy payload drones (around 15 kg payload), and the progress of development of an apparatus carrying fire-extinguishing balls attachable to drones.},

To explore user experiences of normative dissociation and how design affects the likelihood of normative dissociation, we deployed Chirp, a custom Twitter client, to 43 U.S. participants. Experience sampling and interviews revealed that sometimes, becoming absorbed in normative dissociation on social media felt like a beneficial break. However, people also reported passively slipping into normative dissociation, such that they failed to absorb any content and were left feeling like they had wasted their time. We found that designed interventions–including custom lists, reading history labels, time limit dialogs, and usage statistics–reduced normative dissociation. Our findings demonstrate that interaction designs intended to capture attention likely do so by harnessing people’s natural inclination to seek normative dissociation experiences. This suggests that normative dissociation may be a more productive framing than addiction for discussing social media overuse.},

The Situation Awareness-based Agent Transparency (SAT) model was proposed to support human awareness in human–agent teams. As agents transition from tools to artificial teammates, an expansion of the model is necessary to support teamwork paradigms, which require bidirectional transparency. We propose that an updated model can better inform human–agent interaction in paradigms involving more advanced agent teammates. This paper describes the model's use in three programmes of research, which exemplify the utility of the model in different contexts – an autonomous squad member, a mediator between a human and multiple subordinate robots, and a plan recommendation agent. Through this review, we show that the SAT model continues to be an effective tool for facilitating shared understanding and proper calibration of trust in human–agent teams.},

  abstract = {Problems of cooperation--in which agents seek ways to jointly improve their welfare--are ubiquitous and important. They can be found at scales ranging from our daily routines--such as driving on highways, scheduling meetings, and working collaboratively--to our global challenges--such as peace, commerce, and pandemic preparedness. Arguably, the success of the human species is rooted in our ability to cooperate. Since machines powered by artificial intelligence are playing an ever greater role in our lives, it will be important to equip them with the capabilities necessary to cooperate and to foster cooperation. We see an opportunity for the field of artificial intelligence to explicitly focus effort on this class of problems, which we term Cooperative AI. The objective of this research would be to study the many aspects of the problems of cooperation and to innovate in AI to contribute to solving these problems. Central goals include building machine agents with the capabilities needed for cooperation, building tools to foster cooperation in populations of (machine and/or human) agents, and otherwise conducting AI research for insight relevant to problems of cooperation. This research integrates ongoing work on multi-agent systems, game theory and social choice, human-machine interaction and alignment, natural-language processing, and the construction of social tools and platforms. However, Cooperative AI is not the union of these existing areas, but rather an independent bet about the productivity of specific kinds of conversations that involve these and other areas. We see opportunity to more explicitly focus on the problem of cooperation, to construct unified theory and vocabulary, and to build bridges with adjacent communities working on cooperation, including in the natural, social, and behavioural sciences.},

Since the proposal of Ant System, the first ACO algorithm, many significant research results have been obtained. These contributions focused on the development of high performing algorithmic variants, the development of a generic algorithmic framework for ACO algorithm, successful applications of ACO algorithms to a wide range of computationally hard problems, and the theoretical understanding of important properties of ACO algorithms.

  abstract = {An analogy with the way ant colonies function has suggested the definition of a new computational paradigm, which we call ant system (AS). We propose it as a viable new approach to stochastic combinatorial optimization. The main characteristics of this model are positive feedback, distributed computation, and the use of a constructive greedy heuristic. Positive feedback accounts for rapid discovery of good solutions, distributed computation avoids premature convergence, and the greedy heuristic helps find acceptable solutions in the early stages of the search process. We apply the proposed methodology to the classical traveling salesman problem (TSP), and report simulation results. We also discuss parameter selection and the early setups of the model, and compare it with tabu search and simulated annealing using TSP. To demonstrate the robustness of the approach, we show how the ant system (AS) can be applied to other optimization problems like the asymmetric traveling salesman, the quadratic assignment and the job-shop scheduling. Finally we discuss the salient characteristics-global data structure revision, distributed communication and probabilistic transitions of the AS.},

The agent approach in conjunction with geoinformation systems (GIS) permits to efficiently describe the interaction of a big number of participants of wildfire fighting: spreading fire, fire brigades, means of mechanization, air means, etc. In the current paper, this approach is illustrated by an example of two types of agents denoted as A and B. The burning fire line is seen as a chain of type A agents, each of which imitates burning of an elementary area of vegetable fuel. The fire line movement is described by Hamilton–Jacobi equation and is calculated based on the moving grid algorithm. Agents of another type—B-agents—describe fire extinguishing, they approach the agents of A type and affect them decreasing fire intensity to zero. This model is presented by a GIS-oriented software system which may be enhanced and be useful both for fire control management and training personnel in wildfire fighting tactics.}

  abstract = {The process of globalization is being significantly influenced by the integration of technology, and among the technological advancements, drone technology stands out as a prominent example. Drones have witnessed a remarkable increase in their usage across various disciplines, including agriculture, healthcare, and military domains. In agriculture, drones provide farmers with real-time data, empowering them to make well-informed decisions about the utilization of farm inputs. Additionally, drones serve a vital role in the healthcare sector by enabling the aerial delivery of essential medical supplies, such as blood, vaccines, drugs, and laboratory samples, to remote areas in developing nations during critical health emergencies. In the military realm, drones contribute to enhancing security and surveillance operations by monitoring enemy movements and facilitating targeted actions. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that despite their numerous benefits, drones can pose risks, such as potential injuries to individuals and damage to property, especially when operated by untrained personnel or in the event of component failures during flight. Moreover, extremist elements can be hijacking drones to further their agendas and redirect the payload accordingly. This paper aims to comprehensively analyze the current developments in agricultural, medical, and military drones through a rigorous examination of their strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities. \&nbsp;},

Recent years have seen record-breaking wildfire seasons across the world from Australia to the Arctic to North and South America. With global temperatures on the rise, the need to reduce wildfire risk is more critical than ever. A new report, Spreading like Wildfire: The Rising Threat of Extraordinary Landscape Fires, by UNEP and GRID-Arendal, finds that climate change and land-use change are making wildfires worse and anticipates a global increase of extreme fires even in areas previously unaffected. Uncontrollable and extreme wildfires can be devastating to people, biodiversity and ecosystems. They also exacerbate climate change, contributing significant greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere. UNEP is issuing an urgent call to governments to rethink their approach to extreme wildfires. By calling for a new ‘Fire Ready Formula’ and recognizing the important role of ecosystem restoration, we can minimize the risk of extreme wildfires by being better prepared and building back better in their aftermath.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}In this paper we advance team theory by describing how cognition occurs across the distribution of members and the artifacts and technology that support their efforts. We draw from complementary theorizing coming out of cognitive engineering and cognitive science that views forms of cognition as external and extended and integrate this with theorizing on macrocognition in teams. Two frameworks are described that provide the groundwork for advancing theory and aid in the development of more precise measures for understanding team cognition via focus on artifacts and the technologies supporting their development and use. This includes distinctions between teamwork and taskwork and the notion of general and specific competencies from the organizational sciences along with the concepts of offloading and scaffolding from the cognitive sciences. This paper contributes to the team cognition literature along multiple lines. First, it aids theory development by synthesizing a broad set of perspectives on the varied forms of cognition emerging in complex collaborative contexts. Second, it supports research by providing diagnostic guidelines to study how artifacts are related to team cognition. Finally, it supports information systems designers by more precisely describing how to conceptualize team-supporting technology and artifacts. As such, it provides a means to more richly understand process and performance as it occurs within sociotechnical systems. Our overarching objective is to show how team cognition can both be more clearly conceptualized and more precisely measured by integrating theory from cognitive engineering and the cognitive and organizational sciences.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {A* is a search algorithm that has long been used in the pathfinding research community. Its efficiency, simplicity, and modularity are often highlighted as its strengths compared to other tools. Due to its ubiquity and widespread usage, A* has become a common option for researchers attempting to solve pathfinding problems. However, the sheer amount of research done on the topic makes it difficult to know where to start looking. With this paper, we hope to create an accessible, up to date reference on the current state of the A* search algorithm for future pathfinding projects to consider. This paper examines A-Star’s current usage in the field of pathfinding, comparing A* to other search algorithms. It also analyzes potential future developments for A-Star’s development. A* cannot keep up with the demands of current pathfinding problems. Other algorithms can maintain the same performance while also demanding less overhead and this problem only grows worse as grid size increases. However, use of innovative modifications such as different heuristic types or secondary components to the algorithm allow A* to achieve very fast times with good accuracy when dealing with large maps, while only having slightly increased overhead costs for the modifications. While beginning to show its age, improved algorithms based on the classic A* algorithm are more than capable of keeping up with modern pathfinding demands. These derivative search algorithms such as HPA* is used to overcome the limitations of A*. HPA* can compete with and even surpass its competitors depending on the challenge faced.},

  abstract = {Solar- and nuclear-electricity-generation technologies often are deemed “carbon-free” because their operation does not generate any carbon dioxide. However, this is not so when considering their entire lifecycle of energy production; carbon dioxide and other gases are emitted during the extraction, processing, and disposal of associated materials. We determined the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, namely, CO2, CH4, N2O, and chlorofluorocarbons due to materials and energy flows throughout all stages of the life of commercial technologies for solar-electric- and nuclear-power generation, based on data from 12 photovoltaic (PV) companies, and reviews of nuclear-fuel life cycles in the United States, Europe, and Japan. Previous GHG estimates vary widely, from 40 to 180 CO2-eq./kWh for PV, and 3.5–100 CO2-eq./kWh for nuclear power. Country-specific parameters account for many of these differences, which are exacerbated by outdated information. We conclude, instead, that lifetime GHG emissions from solar- and nuclear-fuel cycles in the United States are comparable under actual production conditions and average solar irradiation, viz., 22–49g CO2-eq./kWh (average US), 17–39g CO2-eq./kWh (south west) for solar electric, and 16–55g CO2-eq./kWh for nuclear energy. However, several factors may significantly change this picture within the next 5 years, and there are unanswered questions about the nuclear fuel cycle that warrant further analyses.},

This paper investigates the structural, institutional and political rigidities that affect the adoption of irrigation scheduling technologies in southern European countries and highlights the corresponding opportunities. The recent implementation of water pricing policies, as required under the European Water Framework Directive, could motivate farmers to invest in technologies for improving water management. A review of irrigation water prices in southern Europe found a large range of prices both within and between countries, from 0.054–0.645 €/m3 (Greece) to 0.23–1.50 €/m3 (France). However, inadequate monitoring infrastructure and a lack of political will to impose the new water prices are giving a mixed signal to farmers. An ageing and poorly trained farm population, small farm size and low level of farm investment also impede the uptake of irrigation technologies. Within this context, European-funded research needs to consider these constraints and pay closer attention to the conversion of knowledge and innovation into successful commercial products.},

In previous work, the model was validated at laboratory scale for fire spreading across litters. The model was then modified to consider the structure of actual vegetation and was included in the wildland fire calculation system Forefire that allows converting the two-dimensional model of fire spread to three dimensions, taking into account spatial information. Two wildland fire behavior case studies were elaborated and used as a basis to test the simulator. Both fires were reconstructed, paying attention to the vegetation mapping, fire history, and meteorological data. The local calibration of the simulator required the development of appropriate fuel models for shrubland vegetation (maquis) for use with the model of fire spread. This study showed the capabilities of the simulator during the typical drought season characterizing the Mediterranean climate when most wildfires occur.}

  abstract = {Abstract. Climate~change contributes to the increased frequency and intensity of wildfires globally, with significant impacts on society and the environment. However, our understanding of the global distribution of extreme fires remains skewed, primarily influenced by media coverage and regionalised research efforts. This inaugural State of Wildfires report systematically analyses fire activity worldwide, identifying extreme events from the March 2023–February 2024 fire season. We assess the causes, predictability, and attribution of these events to climate change and land use and forecast future risks under different climate scenarios. During the 2023–2024 fire season, 3.9×106\,km2 burned globally, slightly below the average of previous seasons, but fire carbon (C) emissions were 16\,\% above average, totalling 2.4\,Pg\,C. Global fire C emissions were increased by record emissions in Canadian boreal forests (over 9 times the average) and reduced by low emissions from African savannahs. Notable events included record-breaking fire extent and emissions in Canada, the largest recorded wildfire in the European Union (Greece), drought-driven fires in western Amazonia and northern parts of South America, and deadly fires in Hawaii (100 deaths) and Chile (131 deaths). Over 232\,000 people were evacuated in Canada alone, highlighting the severity of human impact. Our analyses revealed that multiple drivers were needed to cause areas of extreme fire activity. In Canada and Greece, a combination of high fire weather and an abundance of dry fuels increased the probability of fires, whereas burned area anomalies were weaker in regions with lower fuel loads and higher direct suppression, particularly in Canada. Fire weather prediction in Canada showed a mild anomalous signal 1 to 2 months in advance, whereas events in Greece and Amazonia had shorter predictability horizons. Attribution analyses indicated that modelled anomalies in burned area were up to 40\,\%, 18\,\%, and 50\,\% higher due to climate change in Canada, Greece, and western Amazonia during the 2023–2024 fire season, respectively. Meanwhile, the probability of extreme fire seasons of these magnitudes has increased significantly due to anthropogenic climate change, with a 2.9–3.6-fold increase in likelihood of high fire weather in Canada and a 20.0–28.5-fold increase in Amazonia. By the end of the century, events of similar magnitude to 2023 in Canada are projected to occur 6.3–10.8 times more frequently under a medium–high emission scenario (SSP370). This report represents our first annual effort to catalogue extreme wildfire events, explain their occurrence, and predict future risks. By consolidating state-of-the-art wildfire science and delivering key insights relevant to policymakers, disaster management services, firefighting agencies, and land managers, we aim to enhance society's resilience to wildfires and promote advances in preparedness, mitigation, and adaptation.

While weather forecasts are not always perfect, they provide valuable information that can help people make informed decisions and take appropriate actions to protect themselves and their property from the impacts of extreme weather events. In this paper, to forecast the weather we are using the SARIMA model as RMSE is 1.24 and analyse how it forecast the weather with high accuracy. Note that the SARIMA model is a machine learning (ML) technique used to forecast time series data that has both trend and seasonal components. It is an extension of the ARIMA model, which stands for Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average. To account for periodic changes in the data, the SARIMA model augments the ARIMA model with a seasonal component. The SARIMA model is trained on historical weather data and can be used to predict future weather patterns. It is a powerful tool for weather forecasting as it can accurately predict both short-term and long-term weather trends. The quality of the input data determines how accurate the SARIMA model will be, and the model can be adjusted to perform better. In conclusion, the model known as SARIMA is a ML based approach that has been successfully used to predict weather. It is a powerful tool that can handle non-stationary data and seasonal components and can accurately predict short-term and long-term weather trends.},

Traditional wildfire detection and risk assessment methods often suffer from limitations such as delayed detection and low confidence in certain regions. In this paper, we propose a novel computational system based on Machine Learning for wildfire risk assessment using data collected by drones. The system can integrate various sensors to capture spatiotemporal data on environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and vegetation. By leveraging high-resolution data collected through autonomous drone missions, our system enhances wildfire risk estimation and enables proactive mission planning. Although the system is mainly designed to address wildfire monitoring using drone-collected data, it can be easily adapted to other environmental monitoring applications and other sources of data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a comprehensive evaluation and validation process in both simulated and real-world environments. Our work contributes to advancing wildfire monitoring capabilities, improving early detection, and mitigating the impact of wildfires on communities and the environment.},

In this article, we explore the interplay between these algorithms and human agency. Specifically, we consider the extent of entanglement or coupling between humans and algorithms along a continuum from implicit to explicit demand. We emphasize that the interactions people have with algorithms not only shape users’ experiences in that moment but because of the mutually shaping nature of such systems can also have longer-term effects through modifications of the underlying social-network structure. Understanding these mutually shaping systems is challenging given that researchers presently lack access to relevant platform data. We argue that increased transparency, more data sharing, and greater protections for external researchers examining the algorithms are required to help researchers better understand the entanglement between humans and algorithms. This better understanding is essential to support the development of algorithms with greater benefits and fewer risks to the public.},

  abstract = {Robotic systems composed of a large number of entities, often called robot swarms, are envisioned to play an increasingly important role in applications such as search, rescue, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations. Nowadays, many mobile robots that are deployed for such applications are still tele-operated by a single or multiple operators. While these platforms are individually very capable, the development of cheaper hardware allows the consideration of swarm systems composed of many more robots but with each individual being far less powerful. Examples from biology indicate that such systems can be collectively more powerful than any individual robot within the team and also more than many larger, more sophisticated individual robots. Enabling a human to control such bio-inspired systems is a considerable challenge due to the limitations of each individual robot and the sheer number of robots that need to be coordinated to successfully complete a mission. Autonomous algorithms provide an opportunity to mitigate some of the complexity an operator faces in controlling such swarms, but it is not clear either (a) which tasks will ultimately need to be executed by the operator rather than by the swarm, or (b) what kinds of interactions would be needed.},

  abstract = {Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, we propose KolmogorovArnold Networks (KANs) as promising alternatives to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). While MLPs have fixed activation functions on nodes (“neurons”), KANs have learnable activation functions on edges (“weights”). KANs have no linear weights at all – every weight parameter is replaced by a univariate function parametrized as a spline. We show that this seemingly simple change makes KANs outperform MLPs in terms of accuracy and interpretability, on small-scale AI + Science tasks. For accuracy, smaller KANs can achieve comparable or better accuracy than larger MLPs in function fitting tasks. Theoretically and empirically, KANs possess faster neural scaling laws than MLPs. For interpretability, KANs can be intuitively visualized and can easily interact with human users. Through two examples in mathematics and physics, KANs are shown to be useful “collaborators” helping scientists (re)discover mathematical and physical laws. In summary, KANs are promising alternatives for MLPs, opening opportunities for further improving today’s deep learning models which rely heavily on MLPs.},

  abstract = {Cognitive Science has profoundly shaped disciplines such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Philosophy, Psychology, Neuroscience, Linguistics, and Culture. Many breakthroughs in AI trace their roots to cognitive theories, while AI itself has become an indispensable tool for advancing cognitive research. This reciprocal relationship motivates a comprehensive review of the intersections between AI and Cognitive Science. By synthesizing key contributions from both perspectives, we observe that AI progress has largely emphasized practical task performance, whereas its cognitive foundations remain conceptually fragmented. We argue that the future of AI within Cognitive Science lies not only in improving performance but also in constructing systems that deepen our understanding of the human mind. Promising directions include aligning AI behaviors with cognitive frameworks, situating AI in embodiment and culture, developing personalized cognitive models, and rethinking AI ethics through cognitive co-evaluation.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we study trust-related human factors in supervisory control of swarm robots with varied levels of autonomy (LOA) in a target foraging task. We compare three LOAs: manual, mixed-initiative (MI), and fully autonomous LOA. In the manual LOA, the human operator chooses headings for a flocking swarm, issuing new headings as needed. In the fully autonomous LOA, the swarm is redirected automatically by changing headings using a search algorithm. In the mixed-initiative LOA, if performance declines, control is switched from human to swarm or swarm to human. The result of this work extends the current knowledge on human factors in swarm supervisory control. Specifically, the finding that the relationship between trust and performance improved for passively monitoring operators (i.e., improved situation awareness in higher LOAs) is particularly novel in its contradiction of earlier work. We also discover that operators switch the degree of autonomy when their trust in the swarm system is low. Last, our analysis shows that operator's preference for a lower LOA is confirmed for a new domain of swarm control.},

Using the PRISMA framework and BERTopic modeling, it identifies five key pathways shaping AGI’s trajectory: (1) societal integration, addressing AGI’s broader societal impacts, public adoption, and policy considerations; (2) technological advancement, exploring real-world applications, implementation challenges, and scalability; (3) explainability, enhancing transparency, trust, and interpretability in AGI decision-making; (4) cognitive and ethical considerations, linking AGI’s evolving architectures to ethical frameworks, accountability, and societal consequences; and (5) brain-inspired systems, leveraging human neural models to improve AGI’s learning efficiency, adaptability, and reasoning capabilities. This study makes a unique contribution by systematically uncovering underexplored AGI themes, proposing a conceptual framework that connects AI advancements to practical applications, and addressing the multifaceted technical, ethical, and societal challenges of AGI development. The findings call for interdisciplinary collaboration to bridge critical gaps in transparency, governance, and societal alignment while proposing strategies for equitable access, workforce adaptation, and sustainable integration. Additionally, the study highlights emerging research frontiers, such as AGI-consciousness interfaces and collective intelligence systems, offering new pathways to integrate AGI into human-centered applications. By synthesizing insights across disciplines, this study provides a comprehensive roadmap for guiding AGI development in ways that balance technological innovation with ethical and societal responsibilities, advancing societal progress and well-being.},

The following parameters were studied: color combinations for the font and the screen background, font size, column width as well as character, line and paragraph spacing. It was found that larger text and larger character spacing lead the participants with and without dyslexia to read significantly faster. The study is complemented with questionnaires to obtain the participants preferences for each of these parameters, finding other significant effects. These results provide evidence that people with dyslexia may benefit from specific text presentation parameters that make text on a screen more readable.

Several satellite-based indices were evaluated as potential monitoring tools for post-wildfire ecological recovery and management of grasslands. All indices evaluated provided useful information and indicated rapid vegetation recovery from wildfire. The Leaf Water Stress Index (LSWI) and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) showed a distinct response to the wildfire events, and differentiated between burned and unburned areas throughout the post-wildfire growing seasons better than the Normalized Difference Vegetative Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetative Index (EVI). In particular, the LSWI may provide a useful tool for mapping the footprint of wildfire, with potential utility for organizations that provide post-fire recovery resources. The GPP, which estimates the biomass productivity of vegetation, can provide information to livestock operators to guide the re-stocking of cattle in the aftermath of wildfire. In sum, satellite-based proxies can provide timely information both to characterize a wildfire’s footprint and to guide post-fire grazing management in a manner that balances short term needs for forage with long-term productivity and ecological function.},

  abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, are already an integral part of the equipment used by firefighters to monitor wildfires. They are, however, still typically used only as remotely operated, mobile sensing platforms under direct real-time control of a human pilot. Meanwhile, a substantial body of literature exists that emphasises the potential of autonomous drone swarms in various situational awareness missions, including in the context of environmental protection. In this paper, we present the results of a systematic investigation by means of numerical methods i.e., Monte Carlo simulation.~We report our insights into the influence of key parameters such as fire propagation dynamics, surface area under observation and swarm size over the performance of an autonomous drone force operating without human supervision. We limit the use of drones to perform passive sensing operations with the goal to provide real-time situational awareness to the fire fighters on the ground. Therefore, the objective is defined as being able to locate, and then establish a continuous perimeter (cordon) around, a simulated fire event to provide live data feeds such as e.g., video or infra-red. Special emphasis was put on exclusively using simple, robust and realistically implementable distributed decision functions capable of supporting the self-organisation of the swarm in the pursuit of the collective goal. Our results confirm the presence of strong nonlinear effects in the interaction between the aforementioned parameters, which can be closely approximated using an empirical law. These findings could inform the mobilisation of adequate resources on a case-by-case basis, depending on known mission characteristics and acceptable odds (chances of success).},

  abstract = {Wildfires, a natural part of the wildland life cycle, are experiencing a decades-long trend of increased frequency, duration, and magnitude, resulting in increased risk of fatalities and property damage. Fire suppression methods are adapting accordingly, including the increased use of aerial firefighting. Aerial firefighting, conducted in coordination with ground crews, provides real-time reconnaissance of a wildfire and performs strategic drops of retardant to contain and/or suppress the fire. These flight operations require airport and air traffic control infrastructure. The purpose of this report is to provide statistics on the U.S. aerial firefighting fleet, flight operations, and airport utilization and equipment in 2024. This information, which is not readily available, may be of use to airport planners, air navigation service providers, and policy makers. Thirty-four (34) Very Large/Large Air Tankers (VLAT/LATs) were under contract with the United States Forest Service (USFS) Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs) in 2024. The aircraft, ranging in age from 27 to 57 years, performed 11,219 retardant drop and reposition flights. Flights operated on 88\% of the days with an average of 35 flights per day and a maximum of 200 flights per day. The number of flights per aircraft across the fleet was not uniform (average 288 flights, max 465 flights). Consistent with firefighting practices, the flights operated under Visual Flight Rules (VFR), mostly in the afternoons, with an average retardant drop flight duration of 34 min. Two hundred and seven (207) airports supported at least one departure, with 14 airports supporting 50\% of the departures. Eighty-six (86\%) percent of the airports were towered and 84\% had precision approach procedures. All but two military airports were public airports that are part of the National Plan for Integrated Airport System (NPIAS) and eligible for Airport Improvement Plan (AIP) funding. Runway length and weight bearing are limitations at several airports. Furthermore, operations are no longer limited to airports west of the Rockies, with increased operations in the mid-west and east coast.},

This permits rapid change-out of the aircraft so that engines can be tested quickly on operational aircraft. Measurements were made at throttle settings from idle to afterburner using a simple extractive probe in the dilute exhaust. Emission factors determined using this approach agree very well with those from the traditional method of extractive sampling at the exhaust exit. Emission factors are reported for CO2, CO, NO, NOx, and more than 60 hazardous and/or reactive organic gases. Particle size, mass and composition also were measured and are being reported separately. Comparison of the emissions of nine hazardous air pollutants from these two engines with emissions from nine other aircraft engines is discussed.},

  abstract = {In response to escalating climate change concerns, this study evaluates the ecological impact and efficiency of medical sample transportation using drones, combustion cars, and electric cars across various terrains and weather conditions in Liechtenstein and Switzerland. Through a comparative analysis, we found that combustion cars emit the highest average CO2 at 159.5 g per kilometer (g/km), while electric cars significantly reduce emissions to an average of 3.43 g/km, representing just 2.15\% of the emissions from combustion vehicles. Drones emerged as the most environmentally sustainable option, with an average CO2 emission of 0.09 g/km, which is only 0.07\% of combustion car emissions and 2.6\% of electric car emissions. Drones also demonstrated superior transport efficiency, covering routes that were, on average, 17\% shorter in flat terrain and 24\% shorter in mountainous regions compared to cars. Additionally, drones achieved substantial time savings, ranging from 13\% to 80\% faster delivery times depending on the terrain and traffic conditions. These findings highlight the potential of drone technology to revolutionize healthcare logistics by significantly reducing carbon footprints, optimizing transport routes, and improving delivery efficiency. Integrating drones into healthcare transportation networks offers a promising pathway toward a more sustainable and resilient healthcare system.},

Here we find the current practical range of multi-copters to be about 4\,km with current battery technology, requiring a new network of urban warehouses or waystations as support. We show that, although drones consume less energy per package-km than delivery trucks, the additional warehouse energy required and the longer distances traveled by drones per package greatly increase the life-cycle impacts. Still, in most cases examined, the impacts of package delivery by small drone are lower than ground-based delivery. Results suggest that, if carefully deployed, drone-based delivery could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy use in the freight sector. To realize the environmental benefits of drone delivery, regulators and firms should focus on minimizing extra warehousing and limiting the size of drones.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the operational patterns and techniques of aerial fire fighting. It is demonstrated that manoeuvrability and endurance are the main characteristics when choosing air tactical aircraft; focus is on load capability for helicopters and air tankers. Water tank filling and deployment techniques are evaluated. Aircraft using pressure deployment systems are found to produce more uniform and heavy coverage in comparison with gravity systems. ADS-B open source data of flight operations and performance was collected. Operational patterns are found to be independent on the size of particular aircraft category (non-amphibious and amphibious air tanker, helicopter, air-tactical aircraft). Effectiveness and cost are modelled using the retardant dropped per operation and the average number of daily missions. The largest aircraft, Type-I helicopters and very large air tankers (VLAT) are found to be the most effective water- and retardant-dropping aircraft. The best cost-to-litre-dropped ratio for water-dropping aircraft is attributed to Type-III helicopters and amphibious Type-III aircraft; for retardant-dropping aircraft, VLAT are most effective. To maximise fire fighting effectiveness, Type-I helicopters and VLAT should be used as far as possible, with pressure deployment systems.},
